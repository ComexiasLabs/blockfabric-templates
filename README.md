# BlockFabric Smart Contract Templates

Welcome to the official repository for BlockFabric (https://www.blockfabric.dev) Smart Contract Templates. This repository is a curated collection of sample smart contracts designed to be utilized as templates within the BlockFabric platform. Our goal is to simplify and accelerate the development process for blockchain developers by providing a diverse set of starting points for your decentralized applications (dApps) on various blockchains.

### How to Use

**Deploy through BlockFabric**: These templates are directly available on BlockFabric (https://www.blockfabric.dev) as no-code templates and can be used out of the box with the integrated compiler and deployer.

**Clone and Customize**: Clone the specific template that you would like to customize, make any necessary adjustments or customizations to the template to fit your specific requirements, and integrate your GitHub repo on BlockFabric (https://www.blockfabric.dev).
